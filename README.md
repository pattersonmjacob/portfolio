# LMS Portfolio

Welcome to my Learning Management System Portfolio! This site showcases my projects, skills, and achievements in educational technology.

## 📚 About This Portfolio
This is a showcase of my LMS projects and learning journey.

## 🔗 View Live
Visit: `https://pattersonmjacob.github.io/portfolio` once GitHub Pages is enabled or the deployment workflow has run.

> **Automatic deployment**
> A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) is included in this repo. It will publish the contents of the `main` branch to a `gh-pages` branch whenever you push. The resulting site will be served at the URL above.


## 📁 Projects
This repository currently contains a single LMS course described in `course.json`. When the site runs, the React-based front end reads that file and renders the course content inside the portfolio.

Future course files can be added alongside `course.json` and the frontend extended accordingly to display a list of courses.

## 🛠️ Developing & Previewing Locally
You can run a simple static server and open the page in your browser:

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
